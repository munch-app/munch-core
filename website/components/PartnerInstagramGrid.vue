I had the Pork kakuni bowl ($13.80++) which came with stewed pork belly and some assorted vegetables. Sadly, my spice tolerance is very low so i chose level 1 spiciness...but the waiter did mention that you could ask for extra spice to be added on the spot if you feel you can handle a higher level of spiciness while trying the dish\n\nI liked the soup curry which felt really light with a not too overpowering hint of spiciness. Actually, the stewed pork belly stole the show for me because it was really tender with barely any hint of dryness. I would definitely recommend you try this pork belly too\n\nProtip: you can get this at 50% via the eatigo app\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#sgfood #sgigfood #exploreflavours #forkyeah #f52grams #foodporn #foreverhungry #sgfoodie #foodgasm #sgcafe #sgeats #eatbooksg #nom #buzzfeast #sgfoodphotography #foodiegram #onthetableproject #sgfoodstagram #dailyfoodfeed #getinmybelly #eatingfortheinsta #eeeeeats #8dayseat #huffposttaste #burpple #foodbeast #foodoftheday #yum #japanesefood #stfoodtrending"
