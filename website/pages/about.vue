      <h2>Munch is 'the guy'</h2>
      <p>
        The one you call when you need the perfect dinner spot.
        The fellow you text to ask where the absolute best chicken rice stall is to
        settle the score with your friends. The type of foodie that can launch into
        detail about all the places you’d never thought to try or simply point you to
        the perfect hole-in-the-wall to satisfy your cravings.
      </p>
      <p>Munch is the person who you know - knows.</p>
